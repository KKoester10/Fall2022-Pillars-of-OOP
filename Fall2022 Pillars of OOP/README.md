# Pillars of OOP

- Additonal features that explain the why (and how ) particular clases can 
interact with each other within an object-oriented programming language

- Heavily integrated with classes

A.P.I.E.
Abtraction
Polymophism
Inheritance
Encasplation

## Encasplation
- being able to bundle loads of variables together under the umbrella of an object
- The ablility to create classes that encapsulate many different vaiables as properties of an object 
- The ability to choose which properties and methods are being displayed to the public (reason for access modifiers)
- think class creation and object instantiating!!
## Abstraction
- The ability to 'boil' a class down to its most basic components
- The act of 'generalizing' a class to be reused as a base for other classes
- Taking similarities form multiple children and putting them in a new parent class that the other are now derived from
- there are a few different ways to abstract
- Classes, Abstract Classes, Interfaces
- Not all squares(children) are rectangles(parents) but not all rectangleas are squares
## Inheritance
- The act of taking properties and methods from a parent class or interface and using them as your own in a child class
- The other side of Abstraction
- there are a few different ways to inherit
## polymorpish
- the idea that children can act as their parents when needed
- many forms (an object can take on different typings depenents on parent classes and interfaces)
- Children objects in parent cairables can only access properties and mehtods on the parent class 
## Interfaces v. Abstract Classes
- Most general concept for a type of data, allows us to create child classes that are more specific (Abstract Classes)
- Abstract classes, allow you to reuse code, allows us to standarize what we write a little 
- Abstract classes are like root words, whereas interfaces are like adjectives
